# BioFunctional AlAlex API Documentation

## Overview

The BioFunctional AlAlex API is a Flask-based web service designed to interact with the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database. It provides functionalities to upload files, process pathway information, and update data based on pathway interactions.

## Installation

To set up the BioFunctional AlAlex API, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Flask application:

    ```
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

### Uploading Files

You can upload csv files to the BioFunctional AlAlex API using a POST request to the `/kegg` endpoint. The file should be provided as part of the request payload.

### Processing Pathways

Once a file is uploaded, the BioFunctional AlAlex API processes the pathway information contained within the file. It extracts interactions, reactions, and relations from the KEGG database.

### Updating Data

The BioFunctional AlAlex API updates the uploaded file based on the pathway information obtained. It identifies relevant data in the file and modifies it to include pathway interactions and reactions.

### Error Handling

The BioFunctional AlAlex API handles various error scenarios, such as missing columns in the uploaded file and request exceptions during pathway processing.

## Dependencies

The BioFunctional AlAlex API relies on the following Python packages:

- Flask: A lightweight web framework for building web applications.
- Flask-Smorest: An extension for Flask that adds support for OpenAPI documentation.
- Beautiful Soup: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- Requests: A HTTP library for making requests in Python.
- Marshmallow: A library for object serialization and validation.
